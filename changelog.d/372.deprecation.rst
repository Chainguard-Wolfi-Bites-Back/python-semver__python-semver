Deprecate support for Python 3.6.

Python 3.6 reached its end of life and isn't supported anymore.
At the time of writing (Dec 2022), the lowest version is 3.7.

Although the `poll <https://github.com/python-semver/python-semver/discussions/371>`
didn't cast many votes, the majority agree to remove support for
Python 3.6.
